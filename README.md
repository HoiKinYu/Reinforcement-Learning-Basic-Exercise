# Reinforcement Learning Exercise in OpenAI Gym
This repository sharing my practice on Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the OpanAI Gym  http://gym.openai.com by different RL methods.

### Environments provided in OpenAI:
1. Atari
2. Box2D
3. Classic Control

### Logs:
2022-03-13 Uploaded Atari - MsPacman-v0-3M_timesteps.ipynb

Summary:
The agaent trained after 3 million timesteps are doing pretty good job (average score 2000 out of 2600). I feel confidence that if further incrase number of timesteps up to 5 million during, the agent wll be able to finish the MsPacman game with maximun score 2600.
