### Environments provided in OpenAI:

***Summary:***
I tried to ***compare the agaent's performance different between trained for 1 million and 3 million timesteps*** by using exactly the same parameters except number of timesteps to train both agents. The result show that the Agent's performance after training for 3 million timesteps perfrom 55% better in terms of scores received, but the time spending for training by CUP are 3 times more compare to the Agent's performance after training only for 1 million timesteps. 

Hope you enjoy it! Please share with me if you have even better solution or some other interesting environment for practicing RL purpose.
